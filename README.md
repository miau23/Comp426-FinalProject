# Comp426-FinalProject
Final Project for Comp 426

Welcome to my final project which was essentially me making a website to distract me from all my other finals. You can explore 5 different apis from food to dog photos and play a very wonky version of pacman against a friend to waste some time. There are a couple features that are in complete, but it wouldn't properly meet its claim of distracting you from finals if it didn't also distract me from completing itself (it makes sense don't think too hard into it. 

I hope you enjoy toggling around and the funky color scheme and fonts. Maybe even come back later and I'll have some new features for you to enjoy... possibly a log in, paypal, or much much more!! 

Sincerely, 
   Mia Uitz
